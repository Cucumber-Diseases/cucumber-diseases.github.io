# 014: Scenario Overload
*Scenario Overload* occurs when multiple behaviorsrs are tested within a single Scenario, rather than isolating individual behaviors into distinct scenarios.

Each Gherkin scenario should ideally test a single behavior or outcome, maintaining clarity and focus on that specific functionality. When multiple behaviors are combined, the scenario becomes cluttered and difficult to follow, diluting its readability and intent. This leads to confusion about what is being tested and increases the likelihood of introducing false positives or negatives during testing.

## Impact

!!! failure "Decreased Readability"
    When several behaviors are packed into one scenario, it becomes challenging for both developers and stakeholders to easily understand the purpose of the test. The scenario grows in complexity and loses its role as an easily digestible specification of system behavior.

!!! failure "Harder Debugging"
    If a test fails, pinpointing the root cause becomes harder when multiple behaviors are tested together. Test failures can occur for various reasons, and debugging such scenarios requires more time and effort to isolate the problematic behavior.

!!! warning "Reduced Reusability"
    Scenarios that test multiple behaviors are often context-specific and harder to reuse across different test cases. Isolated, singular behavior scenarios, on the other hand, are more modular and can be reused in different situations.

!!! warning "Inconsistent Results"
    Combining behaviors into a single scenario increases the chance of inconsistent results, as unrelated changes in one behavior can inadvertently affect the test outcome for another. This leads to flaky tests that pass or fail under unpredictable conditions.

!!! warning "Maintenance Complexity"
    As the system under test (SUT) evolves, scenarios that test multiple behaviors can require substantial rework. A single change in the behavior of the system could necessitate updating multiple parts of the scenario, leading to an increased maintenance burden over time.

## Required Action

* **Limit Each Scenario to One Behavior:** Ensure each Gherkin scenario tests one specific behavior or outcome. If multiple behaviors need to be tested, create separate scenarios for each. This keeps the tests clear, focused, and easy to maintain.

* **Use Background Steps to Set Context:** If there is shared setup logic required by multiple scenarios, utilize Gherkin's `Background` feature. This avoids duplicating setup steps while still allowing individual scenarios to focus on specific behaviors.

* **Modularize Step Definitions:** Avoid overloading a scenario with numerous actions. Modularize your step definitions to focus on a single, well-defined action per step, keeping scenarios concise and readable.

* **Refactor Complex Logic into Helper Classes:** If a scenario requires setting up multiple conditions for a behavior, delegate the complexity to helper classes or utility functions. Keep the Gherkin steps simple and focused on intent, not implementation.

## Code Example

### Scenario Implementation
```gherkin title="OrderFeature.feature"
  Scenario: Placing and Cancelling an order
    Given the user is logged in
    When the user adds a product to the cart
    And the user checks out
    Then the order should be placed
    When the user cancels the order
    Then the order should be removed
```
